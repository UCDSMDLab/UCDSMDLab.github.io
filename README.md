# Structured Materials and Dynamics Lab

Our group explores the intersection of engineering mechanics, structural dynamics, applied physics, applied mathematics and wave propagation in artificially engineered structured materialsâ€”known as phononic crystals, acoustic/elastic metamaterials and smart architected materials. Through advanced computational modeling, linear and nonlinear dynamics, finite element analysis, and experimentation, we investigate acoustic and elastic wave manipulation, vibration control, noise insulation, and lightweight high-strength energy absorption systems.

Current research focuses on nonlinear metamaterials, nonreciprocal wave propagation, and temporal metamaterials, with applications in adaptive structures, signal processing, and next-generation vibration and noise control technologies. By bridging theoretical mechanics with applied engineering, we aim to design and develop novel structured materials with tailored dynamic properties for real-world challenges.

Join us in pushing the boundaries of metamaterials for next-generation engineering solutions!
